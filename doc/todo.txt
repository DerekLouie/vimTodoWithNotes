Plugin for managing hierarchical to do lists in vim.

ABOUT                                                   *vimtodo-about*

Vimtodo originally started out as a set of syntax highlights for the todo.txt
(http://www.todotxt.com/) format in vim with a few added extras such as
subtasks. However, it quickly grew into a fully fledged task management
system, taking several ideas from Emacs' org-mode (http://www.orgmode.org/).

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                            *vimtodo-installation*

Vimtodo is distributed as a |vimball| package. To install it, to the
following: >
    vim vimtodo.vba
    :so %
    :q

This will install the plugin in your ~/.vim directory, or a different
directory if you have configured vim to install plugins elsewhere.

==============================================================================
BASIC TODO ENTRIES                                      *vimtodo-basics*

To start with, open up a new file, and add the following line to the
beginning: >
    # vim:ft=todo

This line tells vim that the file is a vimtodo file. See |modeline| for more
information. Now write the file, quit and reopen it. Alternative, you can just
type the following to set the filetype without reopening the file: >
    :set ft=todo

To do entries are simply lines in the file that follow a specific format. Add
the following line into the file: >
    TODO 2009-09-01 @computer +learnvim Read vim tutorial

This is a todo entry. You can also add a new entry, with the 'cn' alias. In
insert mode, type 'cn' and a new todo entry along with the current date will
be added. You can also use <Leader>cn in normal mode to add a new entry.
